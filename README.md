# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

The responsive design ensures that the web application renders well on a variety of devices and windows no matter the size. 



## The directions for the assignment

I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. I used Bootstrap to develop my portfolio site with the following: 

   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images
   * A navbar
I did this by creating the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.



### Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirements for this assignment were to : 

* Create a functional and deployed application

* Have a GitHub repository with a README that described this project

* Having a Navbar that is consistent on each page of the depolyed application.

* Have the Navbar on each page and have it contain links to the Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* Have working links.

* Use semantic html.

* Make sure that each page has valid and correct HTML.

* Have the deployed application contain personalized information such as: bio, name, images, links to social media and more.

* Properly utilize Bootstrap functions.

### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* The URLs of the deployed applications

* The URLs of the GitHub repositories
