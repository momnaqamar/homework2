# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

The responsive design ensures that the web application renders well on a variety of devices and windows no matter the size. 



## The directions for the assignment

I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. I used Bootstrap to develop my portfolio site with the following: 

   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images
   * A navbar
I did this by creating the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.



### Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirements for this assignment were to : 

* Create a functional and deployed application

* Have a GitHub repository with a README that described this project

* Having a Navbar that is consistent on each page of the depolyed application.

* Have the Navbar on each page and have it contain links to the Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* Have working links.

* Use semantic html.

* Make sure that each page has valid and correct HTML.

* Have the deployed application contain personalized information such as: bio, name, images, links to social media and more.

* Properly utilize Bootstrap functions.



## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

I made sure to commit early and often. I did this because the commit history is a signal I am actively working on projects and learning new skills. Commit history allows people to revert their codebase in the event that they need to return to the previously written code.

I made single-purpose commits to ensure a clean, manageable history. I wrote descriptive commit messages/reasons so that anyone looking at my project can easily understand its history. I only commited work that was done, not half-done work. I tested my application before I committed my changes to ensure functionality.

## Submission on BCS

This is what is required to be submitted:

* The URLs of the deployed applications

* The URLs of the GitHub repositories
